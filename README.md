## Introduction

Sharing multiple online links can be cumbersome and confusing, especially when you want to direct others to your various social media profiles, personal website, or portfolio. Linki aims to solve this problem by providing a user-friendly platform to create and manage your personal landing page, making it easy for you to share all your important links in one place.

## Key Features

### 1. Landing Page
- A stylish landing page summarizes the app's purpose and functionality.
- Users can log in or register for an account.

### 2. Link and Contact Management
- Users can add, edit, and organize their links and contact information.
- Each set of links can be associated with a unique name, creating a personalized link for easy access (e.g., `linki.com/dexter`).

### 3. User-Specific Link Display
- Users have a dedicated page that displays their added links, social media profiles, and contact details.
